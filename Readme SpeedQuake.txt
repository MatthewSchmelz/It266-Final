Hello and welcome to speedquake! A bullethell mod focused on getting through
the levels as fast as possible

==============
Weapon Changes
==============

Weapons have been modified in order to act like a bullethell and fire much
more projectiles. 

Hitscan weapons now fire out blaster bolts

The railgun now fires a rocket that moves slower and fires blaster bolts

Grenades have been changed to act like small sentury turrets you can throw into a room


==============
Movement Abilities
==============
Dash[H] - Swiftly moves you out of the way of projectiles

SuperSlam [ ] ] - Slams you to the ground, makes you invincible for a few moments
though it renders you unable to move while you recover

Super Jump [K] - Exactly as advertised

Solid Box [J] - Reduces your movementspeed, but makes new enemies unable to see you

Ghost [ U ] - Allows you to start flying and move through objects, careful, dont fall!



==============
Timer
==============

Upon loading up each level, a timer will appear showing how long you have spent in
the level, while it has no penalties or buffs, try to get it as low as possible, you
are speedrunning afterall.

==============
New Perks
==============
DONT FORGET TO GIVE ALL

Quad Damage[q]- Instead of having you deal more damage, you fire out more bullets!

Bursties [b] - You explode in random blaster shots occasionally

Gravity Fondo [e] - I cut this gravity in half!

Speedster [i] - Increases the timescale, but makes you invincible! Go fast!

Firefight Fiesta [l] - The Abilities of Speedster, Quad Shots, and Bursties all in one
Careful.

==============
Death?
==============

Instead of properly dying and reset the level, you simply get a time penalty instead,
combined with having to sit there and look at your enemies for a few moments while
you rethink your life.


===============
Installation?
===============
I made it really simple!
All you have to do is download the mod from
https://mega.nz/folder/cbRzjBoY#hLc55Zs4QADpJ4v8fDY-WA
that link, and place it into your quake folder in your steamapps.

From there, all you need to do is make a shortcut to launch the mod. Simply by adding
+set game speedquake at the end of the quake2's shortcut target.
